  "prompt": "# SC2 Opponent Weakness & Strategy Prompt (30-Second Summary)\n\nYou will receive four inputs:\n\n1. **Opponent Stats Dictionary**  \n   ```\n   {{OPPONENT_STATS}}\n   ```\n\n2. **Opponent MMR History (list of (timestamp, mmr) pairs)**  \n   ```\n   {{OPPONENTS_MMR_HISTORY}}\n   ```\n\n3. **Our Current Races for This Match**  \n   ```\n   {{OUR_RACES}}\n   ```\n\n4. **One-Sentence Summary of My Playstyle**  \n   ```\n   {{MY_PLAYSTYLE}}\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\nProduce a **concise, 30-second summary** that includes the following rules:\n\n---\n\n### **0. Early Exit Condition**\nIf the MMR history or summary lacks enough information to judge strength or trends, respond with:\n\n> “Not enough match history to infer opponent weaknesses or team dynamics.”\n\nThen stop.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Identify the weaker opponent**\nUse only observable metrics:\n- MMR trend direction (rising, falling, flat)\n- Stability vs volatility in the MMR history\n- Relative rating compared to their teammate\n- Their race\n\nIf a name appears **unpronounceable**, say:\n\n> “The Protoss player’s name appears unpronounceable.”\n\nDo **not** attempt phonetic pronunciations.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Provide one sentence explaining *why***\nExamples:\n- “Their MMR is flat while their Terran teammate’s is strongly rising.”\n- “Their performance is more volatile across recent games.”\n- “Their rating lags behind their partner across the entire dataset.”\n\nOnly state what can be supported by the data.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Analyze Team Dynamics**\nDescribe exploitable patterns such as:\n- One player consistently carrying\n- One player losing disproportionately\n- A mismatch in stability (volatile + steady)\n- Race synergy or weaknesses\n- Timing windows implied by MMR swings\n\nKeep it factual.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommend a single actionable strategy**\nThe recommendation must:\n- Use **our races** (`{{OUR_RACES}}`)\n- Align with **my playstyle** (`{{MY_PLAYSTYLE}}`)\n- Exploit the identified team dynamic\n- Be simple and realistic\n\nExamples:\n- “Pressure the weaker player to force uneven fights.”\n- “Hit an early timing before the Terran spikes.”\n- “Force multitasking to exploit their volatility.”\n\n---\n\n## Output Format (Strict)\n- **5–8 sentences total**\n- Includes: weaker player → reason → team dynamic → strategy\n- No speculation beyond the data provided\n"
